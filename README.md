In terms of code, producing Ridge/Elnet/Lasso models are identical procedures except for the parameter of alpha. For this reason, instead of having three long blocks of virtually the same code with the exception of one parameter, I wrapped a single block into a function called regularize(), for which you can specify the desired value of alpha. This function is defined in RegFunc.R. It outputs a list containing all desired objects, such as R^2's, residuals, Runtime's, etc. for a SINGLE sample. To complete the project, this regularize() function was called repeatedly to produce the data and output for the 100 samples. Various options are available such as regularize(alpha, cvplot=TRUE) or regularize(alpha, nosplit=TRUE) to produce CVplots or obtain runtimes on all the data respectively. To be consistent with this style of coding, a function called RF() (defined in RF_Func.R) was created in the same format as regularize(), and outputs similar desired objects. Such a structure greatly simplified the main code.
